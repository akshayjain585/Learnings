/*
 * 1. Trick is to find the minimum element in an array and that would be the number of times array is sorted
 * Example : {10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5}
 * Ans. 2 is the minimum element at index 4, so the arry is sorted 4 number of times.
 * Actual Array : {2,3,4,5,10,11,12,13} : And if its rotated 4 times, it would be {10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5}
 *
 *Solution 1 : Use linear search and find minimum element and return the index. O(n)
 *Solution 2 : Use Binary Search and find minimum element and return the index. O(Logn)
